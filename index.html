      <div class="openquote">&ldquo;</div><p>&emsp; I'm a mechanical engineer currently working in oil tooling and trying to move into software development. I have a strong foundation in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including BootStrap, jQuery, and AngularJS) and I am currently learning full-stack development with the MEAN stack (MongoDB/ExpressJS/AngularJS/NodeJS).</p>
      <p>&emsp; I've gathered some projects on this page that I've been working on as I learn to code. I did these as a part of the <a href='http://freecodecamp.com'>FreeCodeCamp.com</a> curriculum, and I'm working on more projects even as you read this!</p><div class="closequote">&rdquo;</div>

      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt><a href="twitch/index.html">Twitch.tv buddy list</a></dt>
        <dd>This project was an intro to usage of a JSON API, in this case by taking a list of Twitch.tv usernames and displaying some information about them. Also allows you to filter by username and online status.<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="tic-tac-toe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a></dt>
        <dd>A totally unfair game of tic-tac-toe with an unbeatable AI. The graphics in this game are emoji so you may want to use an emoji-friendly browser. Game lets you play first if you lose, game plays first if you tie.<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="wiki/index.html">Wikipedia Search</a></dt>
        <dd>A live-updating article title search using the Wikipedia JSON API. Will also display a random article on command. I call it the "Hello Kitty information getter" because Hello Kitty was all I could think about (and all I searched for) when testing it.<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="weather/index.html">Weather</a></dt>
        <dd>A little weather applet, again practicing JSON requests, uses your IP address to guess your location and allows unit-switching. Displays different graphics based on temperature.<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="calc/index.html">Retro Calculator</a></dt>
        <dd>This retro-style calculator is super cute and just as functional as any other calculator from the seventies. Allows chaining of operations just like a real calculator would. Is not solar powered, unfortunately (I don't think jQuery has caught up enough for that yet).<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="pomodoro/index.html">Pomodoro Timer</a></dt>
        <dd>A cute timer for the pomodoro scheduling program. Input work time and break time and watch as the circle fills up with seconds of your life you'll never get back. Bonus: plays an annoying noise when it gets to zero!<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="twitter/index.html">Twitter API Abuser</a></dt>
        <dd>A rough and dirty hacked-together way of working around Twitter API auth tokens to read a user's tweets. Pushes an RSS feed of my friend @adamjk's tweets through an RSS to JSON filter and displays a random one at the press of a button.<br /><br /></dd>
        <dt><a href="fcc-news/index.html">FreeCodeCampNews</a></dt>
        <dd>Last and pretty much least, another JSON data parsing exercise. This one takes information from the FreeCodeCamp news page and, like, displays it. I guess. </dd>
