      <div class="openquote">&ldquo;</div><p class="text-justify">&emsp; I'm a mechanical engineer currently working in oil tooling and trying to move into software development. I have a strong foundation in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including BootStrap, jQuery, and AngularJS) and I am currently learning full-stack development with the MEAN stack (MongoDB/ExpressJS/AngularJS/Node).</p>
      <p>&emsp; I've gathered some projects on this page that I've been using to help learn to code. I did these as a part of the <a href='http://freecodecamp.com'>FreeCodeCamp.com</a> curriculum, and I'm working on more projects even as you read this!</p><div class="closequote">&rdquo;</div>

      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt><a href="twitch/index.html">Twitch.tv buddy list</a></dt>
        <dd>This project was an intro to usage of a JSON API, in this case by taking a list of Twitch.tv usernames and displaying some information about them. Also allows you to filter by username and online status.</dd>
        <dt><a href="tic-tac-toe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a></dt>
        <dd>A totally unfair game of tic-tac-toe with an unbeatable API. The graphics in this game are Emoji so you may want to use an emoji-friendly browser. Game lets you start if you lose, game plays first if you tie.</dd>
        <dt><a href="wiki/index.html">Wikipedia Search</a></dt>
        <dd>A live-updating title search using the Wikipedia JSON API. Will also display a random article on command. I call it the "Hello Kitty information getter" because that's all I bothered searching for when testing it.</dd>
        <dt><a href="weather/index.html">Weather</a></dt>
        <dd>A little weather applet, again practicing JSON requests, uses your IP address to guess your location and allows unit-switching. Displays different graphics based on temperature.</dd>
        <dt><a href="calc/index.html">Retro Calculator</a></dt>
        <dd>This calculator is a cute, retro-style calculator. Allows chaining of operations just like a real calculator would. Is not solar powered, unfortunately (I don't think bootstrap has caught up enough for that yet).</dd>
        <dt><a href="pomodoro/index.html">Pomodoro Timer</a></dt>
        <dd>A cute timer for the pomodoro scheduling program. Input work time and break time and watch as the circle fills up with seconds of your life you'll never get back. Plays an annoying noise when it gets to zero! </dd>
        <dt><a href="twitter/index.html">Twitter API Abuser</a></dt>
        <dd>A rough and dirty hacked-together way of working around Twitter API auth tokens to read a user's tweets. Pushes an RSS feed of my friend @adamjk's tweets through an RSS to JSON filter and displays them.</dd>
        <dt><a href="fcc-news/index.html">FreeCodeCampNews</a></dt>
        <dd>Last and pretty much least, another JSON data parsing exercise. This one takes information from the FreeCodeCamp news page and, like, displays it. I guess. </dd>
